NAME
    Perinci::Access::Schemeless::DBI - Subclass of
    Perinci::Access::Schemeless which gets lists of entities (and metadata)
    from DBI database

VERSION
    version 0.01

DESCRIPTION
    This subclass of Perinci::Access::Schemeless gets lists of code entities
    (currently only packages and functions) from a DBI database (instead of
    from listing Perl packages on the filesystem). It can also retrieve
    Rinci metadata from said database (instead of from %SPEC package
    variables).

    Currently, you must have a table containing list of packages named
    "module" with columns "name" (module name), "metadata" (Rinci metadata,
    encoded in JSON); and a table containing list of functions named
    "function" with columns "module" (module name), "name" (function name),
    and "metadata" (normalized Rinci metadata, encoded in JSON). Table and
    column names will be configurable in the future. An example of the
    table's contents:

     name      metadata
     ----      ---------
     Foo::Bar  (null)
     Foo::Baz  {"v":"1.1"}

     module    name         metadata
     ------    ----         --------
     Foo::Bar  func1        {"v":"1.1","summary":"function 1","args":{}}
     Foo::Bar  func2        {"v":"1.1","summary":"function 2","args":{}}
     Foo::Baz  func3        {"v":"1.1","summary":"function 3","args":{"a":{"schema":["int",{},{}]}}}

HOW IT WORKS
    The subclass overrides get_meta() and action_list().

METHODS
new(%args) => OBJ
    Aside from its parent class, this class recognizes these attributes:

    *   dbh => OBJ (required)

        DBI database handle.

FAQ
  Rationale for this module?
    If you have a large number of packages and functions, you might want to
    avoid reading Perl modules on the filesystem.
